    "In this lesson you will be creative with images. Starting with image files, you will load image objects into memory and then do interesting things with them. What are image files? They're data, really just zeros and ones. Images can be stored and retrieved like any other data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once an image is in memory, we can perform a \"simple\" action on it like enlarging, brightening, or rotating it. These verbs abstract a complicated operation that can involve millions of calculations. When you move a window on the screen, click on a menu, or even just move the mouse, the pixels on the screen change. These are manipulations of images. In each case the central processing unit and the processors on the graphics card handle millions of ones and zeros to render fresh images on the monitor. How do we use objects and methods to handle these complex operations? Good Luck!\n",
